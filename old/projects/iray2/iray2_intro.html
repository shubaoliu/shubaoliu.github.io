<h3>Abstract:</h3> This work addresses the problem of capturing 3D geometry and appearance from multiple 2D images taken from different views, which has wide applications in virtual reality, entertainment, human-computer interface, surveillance, navigation, and high-level vision tasks, etc. In this work, we present an <u><i>inverse ray tracing</i></u> approach based on statistical inference. Instead of matching image features/pixels across images, the inverse ray tracing approach models the image generation process directly and searches for the best 3D geometry and surface reflectance model to explain all the observations. <i>It can better handle difficult problems in multi-view stereo, including large camera baseline, occlusion, matching ambiguities, etc. than traditional methods, without additional information and assumptions, such as initial surface estimate or simple background assumption.</i> Here the image generation process is modeled through volumetric ray tracing, where the <u><i>oclusion/visibility is accurately modeled</i></u>. All the constraints (including ray constraints and prior knowledge about the geometry) are put into the <u><i>Ray Markov Random Field</i></u> (Ray MRF) formulation. This MRF model is unusual in the sense that the ray-clique, which models the ray-tracing process, consists of thousands of random variables, instead of two to dozens as in typical MRFs. This presents a big challenge to the inference algorithm, because of the combinatorial explosion of possible configurations. In this work an algorithm with <u><i>linear computational complexity</i></u> is developed to solve the estimation problem. More specifically, we show that a highly optimized belief propagation algorithm, <u><i>deep belief propagation</i></u> (DBP), can tackle the challenging problem effectively and efficiently, by exploring the deep factorization structure of the ray-clique energy. Then the DBP algorithm is also extended to solve the inference problem for a broader class of <u><i>higher-order MRFs</i></u>. <i> The algorithm developed is capable of handling general and complex scenes of large varieties, general camera configurations (both small and large baselines), and can generate accurate and photo-realistic 3D models</i>. These have been verified by extensive experiments on standard and home-grown challenging datasets.
