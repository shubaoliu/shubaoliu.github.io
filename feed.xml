        <title>Three Aspects of Brain-Like Learning</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a hot topic (again), due to the recent success (and hype) of deep learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technological breakthrough of deep learning is real and has made many things from impossible to possible. The excitement has made some people believe we will soon achieve human brain-level intelligence, or so called “singularity”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to be cautious on what we have achieved. In this figure below, I list three aspects of brain-level learning capability:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learning from labeled raw data,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learning from unlabeled data, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;learning from little data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These three aspects are illustrated as the three dimensions of a cube, where the brain-like intelligence lies at the far-right corner. We need all of these three capabilities to achieve human brain-level AI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/three_dimensions_of_brain_like_learning.png&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we have achieved with deep learning is only the first dimension: learning from labeled raw data. Given large amount of input-output pair training data, it automatically learns hierarchical features and build an input-to-output mapping. This kind of learning is also called imitation learning. It has severe limitations: It never learns anything new other than imitating what’s provided; It has poor adaptivity with the changing environment; And it requires large amount of expert provided training data. This is an expensive solution in many applications, such as health care. This is also a fragile solution in many fully autonomous applications, such as self-driving cars and robotics, where the AI agent needs to adapt to constantly changing environment. And this does not provide a solution for applications where we need to discover new patterns in data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we need next is breakthroughs in unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning, which will create machines that can learn autonomously from the unlabeled raw data with little or no supervision. This is the next frontier of AI research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, we need to make progress in the following three paradigms at the same time to achieve the three capabilities of brain-like learning:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;deep (supervised) learning,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;unsupervised learning,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;semi-supervised learning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
